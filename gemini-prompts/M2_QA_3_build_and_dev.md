Task: BUILD and START the app.

Steps:
1) Build:
   pnpm run build

2) Start dev server:
   pnpm run dev
   # If dev is already running in another terminal, note that and skip starting a second one.

What to watch for:
- Build completes without errors.
- Dev server logs “ready” and lists http://localhost:3000

Report back:
- PASS/FAIL for build
- PASS/FAIL for dev server starting
- Any errors with the last ~20 log lines and a one-line fix
- Confirm the local URL to open
