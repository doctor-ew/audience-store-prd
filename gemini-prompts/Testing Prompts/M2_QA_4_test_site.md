We're inside ./audience-store with the dev server running.

Task: TEST the site in the browser (minimal checks, no auth yet).

## Enhanced Testing with Serena MCP:

### Automated Browser Testing (if Puppeteer MCP available):
Use MCP to automate browser testing:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Take screenshot for visual verification
3. Check for console errors
4. Test form interactions on /sell page
5. Verify database updates after form submission

### Manual Testing + MCP Verification:
Open http://localhost:3000 and verify:
- The page loads without runtime errors
- Use MCP to query database and confirm displayed items match

If the homepage was implemented for Milestone 2.4:
- Empty state shows when no items exist
- Use MCP: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Items WHERE purchasedById IS NULL`
- Verify UI matches database state

If /sell exists (2.3):
- http://localhost:3000/sell loads a form
- Submit test item
- Use MCP to verify: `SELECT * FROM Items ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT 1`
- Confirm new item appears in database

## MCP-Enhanced Monitoring:
- Use MCP to log test results to external service
- Query database for data consistency checks
- Monitor API response times via MCP fetch

Report back (bullet points):
- Homepage load: PASS/FAIL with any console errors
- Database state matches UI: PASS/FAIL
- Sell page form functional: YES/NO with MCP verification
- Any data inconsistencies found via MCP queries
- Next action you recommend (e.g., "Proceed to 3.x prompts")
