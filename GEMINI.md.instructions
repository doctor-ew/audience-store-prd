## Project Overview

This is a Next.js project for a simple web application called "Audience Store". The application allows users to sign up, list items for sale, and purchase items from other users using a credit-based system. The project is intended as a teaching demo to illustrate the process of building a web application from a Product Requirements Document (PRD).

The project is built with the following technologies:

*   **Framework:** Next.js (using the App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Linting:** ESLint

## Building and Running

To get started with the project, you can use the following commands:

*   `npm install`: Installs the project dependencies.
*   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
*   `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build of the application.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase to ensure code quality.

## Development Conventions

The project follows the standard conventions for a Next.js application. Here are some key points:

*   **Project Structure:** The main application code is located in the `audience-store/src/app` directory.
*   **TypeScript:** The project uses TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Utility classes should be used whenever possible.
*   **Linting:** ESLint is configured to enforce a consistent coding style.
